# Carnest-App
Carnest solves the problem of inefficient and costly commuting by allowing individuals to share space in their cars with others going to the same destination. It connects riders and drivers, promoting carpooling to reduce traffic, lower transportation costs, and provide an eco-friendly commuting alternative.
